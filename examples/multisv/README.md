### Training data
This recipe uses an extended version of the MultiSV training data. At the time being, a description of data simulation is provided at https://github.com/BUTSpeechFIT/MultiSV/blob/main/
training/metadata/MultiSV2_train.zip. It contains information about speech and noise cuts along with parameters for ISM-based synthetic room impulse response generation (e.g., for [RIR generator](https://github.com/ehabets/RIR-Generator)). We do not release the data itself due to licensing.

### Evaluation data
The evaluation data is based on the [VOiCES corpus](https://iqtlabs.github.io/voices/). Before running experiments, please make sure to download the data following [the description](https://iqtlabs.github.io/voices/downloads/).
